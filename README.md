# Home Branch

Beginning as a touch up to the dashboard page. Forked from the presentation branch; this is expanding to refactoring the general structure of the application. Condenseing pages and elements to make the webstie more intuitive to use and reduce the number of required pages.
This means it will have addtional changes outside of the dashboard focusing on a similar layout while still keep the core intact and the functionality more or less the same.

## Future Plans
- Tweak navigation information to provide a clearer distinction between Statement of Work(s) and Templates.
  - In current implementation across the application they are used interchangeably but they are not the same. I want to provide an ease of use for both in the same place while still keep a clear distinction between the two.

## Need more commit information?

Home-01: Additional changes, sidebar elements have been removed and condesned to include less options. The template base in functionaly the current homepage the main page redirects to this when the site loads and the shortcut has had it's navigation replaced to accomidate this. Some dashboard elements have been removed as part as the initial intent of the refactor and the rest were transfered over to this new page.

Home-02: Readme update to provide clarity and remove old structure inherited from main.
